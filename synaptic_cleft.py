# Synaptic Cleft Model
#
# Models the space between neurons, including concentration of various
#     neurotransmitters, their corresponding enzymes, and the metabolic
#     processes that affect neurotransmitter concentration.
#
# Presynpatic neurons pump neurotransmitters into the synaptic cleft.
#
# Synaptic neurotransmitters bind stochastically to postsynaptic neuron
#     receptors.
