# Neural Network
#
# The neural network is a factory used to create subcellular components, full
#     neurons, and neural assemblies.  Components get assigned an identifier to
#     aid in synchronizing activity over time steps.
#
# Neural Networks hold buffers for neurotransmitter concentration.
# Computations are performed on the previous timestep's concentrations
