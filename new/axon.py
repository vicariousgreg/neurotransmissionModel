        Axons keep track of activation and release neurotransmitters over
            time.  Neurotransmitters are regenerated via reuptake and
            replenishing.

        |synaptic_cleft| is the synaptic cleft this axon releases into.
        |transporter| is the type of transporter on the axon membrane.
        |reuptake_rate| is the concentration of reuptake receptors on the
            membrane, and controls the rate of neurotransmitter reuptake.
        |capacity| is the neurotransmitter capacity in the axon vesicles.
        |replenish_rate| controls the regeneration of neurotransmitter 
            over time.  Higher values increase rate of restoration.
        |delay| specifies how long it takes the axon to respond, and sets
            the size of a queue.

        Axons respond directly to the voltage of the neuron, and have both a
            threshold minimum voltage for activity, and a ceiling for voltage.
        Voltage determines the rate of neurochemical release according to a
            particular release function.
        Release pulls from a pool tracked by self.concentration.  This pool is
            also automatically regenerated according to the |replenish rate|,
            and externally via reuptake from the synaptic cleft according to
            the |reuptake rate|.  This interaction is mediated by the synaptic
            cleft itself, and depends on the |transporter| protein on the axon.
