# Photoreceptor Soma Model
#
# Photoreceptors do not generate action potentials.  Instead, they have a base
#     current that triggers the release of glutamate in the dark.  With light
#     activation, ion conductance is reduced, and less glutamate is released.
#     The end result is high release in the dark, low release in the light.
